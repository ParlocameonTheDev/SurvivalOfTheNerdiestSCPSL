# SurvivalOfTheNerdiestSCPSL
Use the command **sotnenable 1** to enable the gamemode, and **sotnenable** to toggle it back off.
This is a beta, and does not have much documentation at the moment.

# Description:
Each round consists of at least one 049-2, with a max of 4. If one of the 049-2 kills you, you become one of them. If you want to survive, either kill all of the zombies and supress the infection, or power on all of the generators to lift the lockdown and get an O5, which can open the entrance zone, making for a swift escape";
